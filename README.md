# Rental Housing App

This is a Django-based web application designed to enhance the rental process by providing a safer and more secure way to manage security deposit guarantees, perform background checks, and crowdsource rental deposits.

The concept is that renters looking for rentals currently pay high fees per application under the guise that the owner needs to have a fee to run a background check. The background check service is $30 monthly for a large volume of background checks. This single site would allow renters and landlords to pay one fee and list their rentals, look for rentals, vet renters or landlords, provide a security deposit, and sign lease agreements as well as insure their property with one small monthly fee.

The app includes an admin portal, renter and landlord dashboard, mapbox plugin, and a way to sign documents and send messages. I used Hashicorp vault secrets as a test although the implementation was finicky so the example doesn't utilize this. 

I wanted something that was scaleable and easy to use, as well as offered a lot of support, Django met these requirements.
